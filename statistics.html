        As of 2021, Travis Scott's net worth comes to an estimated $50 million, thanks to his musical endeavours and brand deals. As well as his successful solo rap career, Scott has a huge back catalogue of production credits under his name for artists including Rihanna, Drake, Kanye West, Jay Z, Big Sean and more. He's done pretty well for himself since his parents cut him off financially after he dropped out of university!
        The pair began dating just months after Kylie's split with Tyga and, within weeks, got matching butterfly tattoos. Rumours began swirling that Kylie was pregnant with Scott's child in September 2017. Following months of speculation, the birth of their daughter Stormi was announced on 4th February 2018. The couple are currently expecting their second child.
        Travis Scott stands at 177cm (around 5ft10), the same height as Chance The Rapper and A$AP Rocky.
